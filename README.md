# Implement a design from scratch
## Holberton School Headphone website demo

In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. we will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledge that we learned previously.

We won’t have a lot of instruction, we are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here is the final result:
This website is responsive, the layout is changed with the size of the screen. ✨


## Features

- Mainly adapt 3 group of screens, mobile phone(width less than 586px), tablate(width between 586px and 768px) and computer(width larger than 768px)
- The max width of the main content is 1000px, if the screen is larger than 1000px, the contenct will be adjusted and always lay in the center.
- svg icon used to reduce the size of the file transfered between client and server
- css class reused to minimize the number of code lines and improve the efficiency
